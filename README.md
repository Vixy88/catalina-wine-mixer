# Catalina Wine Mixer

I am building this game as part of my Software Engineering Course with General Assembly, this is my first individual project as part of the course.

We were tasked with creating a simple game with JavaScript, HTML/CSS.

I have chosen to create a fun game that is based on the movie Stepbrothers.
## Game Logic:

The game is a simple game where the player has to complete the mini challenges to increase the time and complete the game and the below logic explains how the game works.

- The Player starts with 25 seconds left
- The Player starts with a score of 0
- The Player can move freely around the screen
- The Player has to collect champagne bottles to score points (1 point per bottle collected) when 5 champagne bottles has been collected it launches a mini challenge, the mini challenge will add 15 points to the player score if they answer correctly and continue the game. 
- The game is completed when ALL champagne bottles have been collected

## Alpha Features:

- Character screen where you can choose between Brennan and Dale
- 2d Characters (different shirt color dependant on the character)
- Interface for the character to move around
- Interface that shows score, timer and restart button
- Mini challenge that has to be completed to continue and complete the game
- Win Screen
- Loose Screen


## Additional Features:
- Traps that can be placed randomly on the interface for the character to avoid
- Older brother chasing the character, if he catches them they die and the Catalina Wine Mixer is a failure
- Persistent Leaderboard using << localStorage >> (for beta version)
