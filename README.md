# Catalina Wine Mixer

I am building this game as part of my Software Engineering Course with General Assembly, this is my first individual project as part of the course.

We were tasked with creating a simple game with JavaScript, HTML/CSS.

I have chosen to create a fun game that is based on the movie Stepbrothers.
## Game Logic:

The game is a simple game where the player has to complete the mini challenges to increase the time and complete the game and the below logic explains how the game works.

- The Player starts with a health of 100
- The Player starts with 60 seconds left
- The Player starts with a score of 0
- The Player can move freely around the screen
- The Player has to move to highlighted #GREEN objectives to complete the mini challenges, these mini challenges will add 30 seconds extra when completed + Add 25 points to the player score

## MVP Features:

- Character screen where you can choose between Brennan and Dale
- 2D Sprite Character Animation
- Interface for the character to move around
- Interface that shows characters health, score and timer
- Mini challenges that has to be completed to increase the time and complete the game
- Win Screen
- Loose Screen


## Additional Features:
- Traps that can be placed randomly on the interface for the character to avoid
- Older brother chasing the character, if he catches them they die and the Catalina Wine Mixer is a failure
